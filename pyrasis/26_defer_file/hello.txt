Caller reports file and line number information about function invocations on the calling goroutine's stack. The argument skip is the number of stack frames to ascend, with 0 identifying the caller of Caller. (For historical reasons the meaning of skip differs between Caller and Callers.) The return values report the program counter, file name, and line number within the file of the corresponding call. The boolean ok is false if it was not possible to recover the information.

Callers fills the slice pc with the return program counters of function invocations on the calling goroutine's stack. The argument skip is the number of stack frames to skip before recording in pc, with 0 identifying the frame for Callers itself and 1 identifying the caller of Callers. It returns the number of entries written to pc.

Note that since each slice entry pc[i] is a return program counter, looking up the file and line for pc[i] (for example, using (*Func).FileLine) will return the file and line number of the instruction immediately following the call. To look up the file and line number of the call itself, use pc[i]-1. As an exception to this rule, if pc[i-1] corresponds to the function runtime.sigpanic, then pc[i] is the program counter of a faulting instruction and should be used without any subtraction.
